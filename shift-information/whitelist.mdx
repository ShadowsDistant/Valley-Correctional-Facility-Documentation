<Warning>
  Our whitelist program is ending, all community members will now be allowed to attend shifts.
</Warning>

# Overview

A whitelist is required to attend a shift. If you don't have the "whitelist" role in our Discord, then you won't be able to attend our shifts. Whitelisting helps us ensure that attendees are familiar with our rules and regulations, and that they are aware of what's expected of them.

## Becoming Whitelisted

To apply for a whitelist, look in our Discord for the channel where you can apply. You will be prompted to apply using the Discord bot Appy. After completing and answering the questions within the application, it will be sent to our review team.

After they review it, you will get a notification saying you've either been approved or denied. Denied applicants must wait 72 hours before they can apply again. Approved applicants will receive the whitelist role in our Discord and will gain immediate access to the shift channel.

## Revoked Whitelist

If a member of the community who is on the whitelist shows that they cannot follow our rules and regulations or Valley Prison's rules, our staff team reserves the right to remove you from our whitelist.
