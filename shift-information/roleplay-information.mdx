## Roleplay Types

To ensure that our community is safe and fun for everyone, we recommend that players do the following types of roleplay. Also listed are the dos and don'ts. For every kind of scene. This is **NOT** a full list, and goes over some of the most popular scenes; it also doesn't include a full list of don'ts.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Medical Scene">
    Roleplay having a headache, or other appropriate medical emergency. You are not allowed to roleplay drug usage, mental health issues, or any medical roleplay deemed inappropriate by our team.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hostage Situations">
    Roleplay taking another player hostage using some sort of weapon or force. What we don't allow is: taking more than one person hostage at a time, failing to engage in negotiations, and making unrealistic demands.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Disobeying Orders">
    Not following orders given to you by a member of the Department of Corrections. But continuously disobeying orders or having disregard for your safety is not allowed.

## Roleplay Rules

Below you can find the defenition for each rule of roleplay. Players are expected to know theses terms along with what they mean so they can avoid possible moderation.

### Fail Roleplay

All players who fail to engage in roleplay have broken this rule. Players aren't forced to roleplay in scenes they don't want to. But continuously using that as an excuse will not work.

### Fear Roleplay

Each character must act fearfully when faced with a situation in which a real person would be fearful.

**Example:** An inmate who continues to defy commands even when faced with the use of tasers or other weapons.

### No Intent to Roleplay

NITRP, better known as No Intent to Roleplay, is when a player refuses to roleplay, has multiple violations of fear roleplay, or fails roleplay. Any player who meets the following criteria will be removed.

### Forced Roleplay

No member of our community is allowed to force you to engage or interact with a roleplay scene in which you don't want to. This can include inmates attempting to force you to join a riot, or a CO attempting to force you to violate a prison rule.

### Inappropriate Roleplay

Roleplay scenes that promote, depict, or otherwise show terrorism, suicide, self-harm, dating, gore, NSFW, political topics, or any other topic that a moderator deems inappropriate. Doing such roleplay will result in an immediate removal from shifts and a possible removal from our community.

### In-Character & Out-Of-Character

Both IC (In-Character) and OOC (Out-Of-Character) can be used in shifts. When you are in character, you are expected to be roleplaying or able to. When you are out of character, you are placing yourself temporarily out of roleplay. Out of character should be used when chatting off topic during a shift. To signal that you are out of character, we recommend surrounding your message with ().

### Medical Roleplay

When in a medical roleplay scene, you are not allowed to control the state and health of your character beyond the initial context. This means you can't force your character to die or come back to life. If you require medical staff but none are available, you may choose to wait or respawn.
