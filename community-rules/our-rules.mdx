# Rules & Guidelines

<Warning>
  _"I haven't read the rules"_ is **NOT** an excuse for violating them. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date on our rules.
</Warning>

## General Community Conduct

These rules apply across our entire community, including Discord and in-game shifts.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discrimination and Hate Speech" icon="ban">
    This server is a community for everyone. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of discrimination or hate speech, including targeting individuals or groups based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, national origin, or personal beliefs.

    **What this means:** You cannot harass, insult, or exclude someone based on who they are. Our goal is to be a welcoming space, and this behavior directly undermines that.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Using racial, homophobic, or transphobic slurs.
    - Making derogatory jokes about a specific religion or nationality.
    - Refusing to interact with someone because of their gender or sexual orientation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Respect and Common Courtesy" icon="handshake">
    All members must treat each other with respect, even during disagreements. Engage in discussions in good faith and avoid personal attacks. Harassment, bullying, belittling, or intimidating other users is strictly forbidden.

    **What this means:** You can disagree with an idea, but you cannot attack the person. Focus on the topic, not on insulting the individual you are talking to.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - "That's a stupid idea, you don't know what you're talking about."
    - Repeatedly messaging a user who has asked you to stop.
    - Publicly shaming or mocking another member for their opinions or roleplay style.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Profanity and Derogatory Language" icon="face-swear">
    General profanity (cursing) is allowed in moderation. However, using profanity, slurs, or any derogatory terms to insult, attack, or degrade another user is strictly prohibited.

    **What this means:** The context of your language matters. Swearing out of frustration is different from swearing at someone to hurt them. All slurs are forbidden, regardless of intent or target.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Calling another user an insulting name combined with a curse word.
    - Using any slur, even if directed at no one in particular.
    - Using derogatory terms related to mental health as an insult (e.g., calling something "r\*\*\*\*\*ed").
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal Information (PII)" icon="user-secret">
    Protect your privacy and the privacy of others. Do not share Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on the server. This includes asking others for their PII.

    **What this means:** PII is any information that can be used to identify you in the real world. Sharing it can put you and others at risk.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Sharing a person's full name, home address, or phone number.
    - Posting photographs of yourself, your family, or your home.
    - Sharing links to personal social media profiles like Facebook or Instagram.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Threats, Blackmail, and Doxxing" icon="skull-crossbones">
    Any threat against another user is strictly forbidden. This includes threatening to reveal or distribute their private information (doxxing), blackmailing them for any reason, or making threats of real-world harm.

    **What this means:** This is a serious offense that creates an unsafe environment. All such threats will result in an immediate and permanent ban, and a report will be filed with the Discord Trust & Safety team.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Posting a user's IP address (whether it's real or fake).
    - Threatening to share a user's real-life location or personal photos.
    - Making any statement that suggests you intend to cause real-world harm to someone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inappropriate and NSFW Content" icon="eye-slash">
    Do not post content that is Not Safe For Work (NSFW) or gratuitously shocking. This rule applies to text, images, videos, and links.

    **What this means:** This is not an adult-themed server. All content should be appropriate for a general audience.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Posting pornography or sexually explicit material.
    - Sharing images or videos of extreme or real-life gore, mutilation, or death.
    - Making insensitive jokes or memes about real-world tragedies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Discussion of Real-World Tragedies & Politics" icon="newspaper">
    Discussions about real-world tragedies and disasters are permitted, but they must be handled with maturity and respect. To maintain a peaceful community, discussions about real-world politics, political figures, and partisan debates are not allowed.

    **What this means:** You can express sympathy for an event, but you cannot use it to be insensitive or spread misinformation. Political arguments often lead to hostility, which we want to avoid.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Sharing memes or jokes about the victims of a natural disaster.
    - Debating political parties, candidates, or recent elections.
    - Spreading unverified rumors or conspiracy theories about a tragic event.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disclosure of Classified Information" icon="file-lock">
    Members are prohibited from disclosing, or claiming to possess, classified or confidential information related to Valley Correctional Facility. This also includes knowing about the possession of such information by another member and not reporting it.

    **What this means:** Information about internal operations and staff discussions is kept private to ensure fairness. Leaking this information can create distrust and disrupt the community.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Sharing screenshots from confidential staff or Department of Corrections channels.
    - Publicly claiming that you have access to or have been sent confidential information.
    - Hinting at sensitive staff discussions to cause drama or influence other members.

## Discord-Specific Rules

These rules apply to conduct within our Discord server.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Language" icon="language">
    To ensure effective moderation and clear communication, this is an English-only server. Using other languages in public channels is not permitted.

    **What this means:** Our staff team can only enforce the rules if they can understand what is being said. This policy is in place to protect all members.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Holding a conversation in a language other than English in a public channel.
    - Posting text or memes in a language other than English.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Malicious and Unverified Links" icon="link-slash">
    Do not post links that are unverified, suspicious, or malicious. All links are subject to review and may be automatically deleted to protect our users.

    **What this means:** Malicious links can be used to spread viruses, steal personal information (phishing), or track your IP address.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Posting links to illegal software, pirated content, or scam websites.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Self-Promotion and Advertising" icon="rectangle-ad">
    Users are prohibited from advertising or promoting their personal projects, social media, or other Discord communities without explicit permission from staff.

    **What this means:** This includes sending unsolicited links to your YouTube channel, Twitch stream, or personal Discord server. Attempting to recruit members for another community ("poaching") is strictly forbidden.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Posting a link to your Twitch stream in a general chat channel.
    - Sending unsolicited DMs to members with invites to another Discord server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Channel & Ticket Misuse" icon="signs-post">
    Please use channels for their designated purposes and the support ticket system for serious inquiries only.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Posting memes in an incorrect channel or asking for support in general chat.
    - Opening a ticket to troll staff, make false reports, or spam the system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Spamming and Mass Mentioning" icon="paper-plane">

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Sending the same message three or more times in a row.
    - Pinging a staff member to say hello.
    - Mentioning multiple users in a single message for no reason.

    All text channel rules apply to voice channels. Avoid intentionally disrupting conversations. Discord Activities may only be launched while a moderator is present and supervising the session.

## In-Game Roleplay Rules

These rules apply to conduct within our Roblox game shifts.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fail Roleplay (FRP)" icon="person-falling-burst">
    Fail Roleplay occurs when a player's actions are unrealistic, nonsensical, or break the immersion of the prison environment.

    **What this means:** You are roleplaying as a character within a correctional facility. Your actions should reflect a realistic understanding of your character's limitations and the environment.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - An inmate walking up to a heavily armed Corrections Officer and showing no fear.
    - Claiming to have unrealistic abilities, like breaking a steel door with bare hands.
    - Not roleplaying injuries after being tased or hit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Forbidden Roleplay Themes" icon="do-not-enter">
    Engaging in roleplay themes that are overly graphic, sexual, or based on sensitive real-world topics is strictly forbidden.

    **What this means:** We have firm boundaries on roleplay topics. We do not permit extreme or degenerate roleplay that crosses into deeply uncomfortable or forbidden territory.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Engaging in any form of romantic, intimate, or sexual roleplay (NSFW/Dating).
    - Graphically describing acts of torture or dismemberment in extreme detail.
    - Roleplaying large-scale, politically motivated attacks or bomb threats.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Powergaming & Metagaming" icon="brain-circuit">
    **Powergaming** is forcing actions upon another player without giving them a chance to react. **Metagaming** is using out-of-character (OOC) knowledge to give your in-character (IC) person an unfair advantage.

    **What this means:** You only control your own character's attempts, not their outcomes. You must also separate what YOU know from what your CHARACTER knows.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - (Powergaming) Roleplaying "tackles the inmate" instead of "attempts to tackle the inmate."
    - (Metagaming) Learning about a riot via Discord and having your CO character prepare for it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Intrusion, Baiting, and Trolling" icon="ghost">
    Do not force your way into scenes you aren't a part of. Do not intentionally provoke staff with low-effort, unrealistic actions to get a reaction. Do not intentionally disrupt the game to ruin the experience for others.

    **What this means:** Respect the stories other players are building. Your in-character actions should have an in-character purpose, not just be for OOC boredom or malice.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Walking into an interrogation and starting a random conversation.
    - Repeatedly pulling out a minor contraband item in front of a CO just to annoy them.
    - Spamming tool sounds or animations during a serious roleplay scene.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Roblox Voice Chat (VC) Usage" icon="microphone-lines-slash">
    Voice Chat within the Roblox game is to be used for in-character communication ONLY and is a privilege. All conversations must be relevant to the ongoing roleplay situation.

    **What this means:** The in-game VC is an extension of the roleplay environment. Out-of-character (OOC) conversations must be held outside of the game.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Having a casual OOC conversation with another player via VC.
    - Insulting another player OOC using the in-game voice chat.
    - Playing music or making disruptive noises through your microphone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Non-Compliance with Staff" icon="user-shield">
    Refusing to follow a direct, out-of-character order from a server Moderator is a serious offense.

    **What this means:** This rule is about moderator instructions, not in-character orders from a CO. When a staff member with an "Administrator" tag speaks to you OOC, their instruction is final.

    **Examples of violations:**

    - Ignoring a moderator who tells you to stop breaking a rule.
    - Leaving the game to avoid a moderator who has frozen you.
    - Arguing with a staff member's decision in a public channel instead of using the appeal process.
