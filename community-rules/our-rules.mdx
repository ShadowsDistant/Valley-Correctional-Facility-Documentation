</Warning>

# Discrimination and Hate Speech

This server is a community for everyone. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of discrimination or hate speech, including targeting individuals or groups based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, national origin, or personal beliefs.

- **What this means:** You cannot harass, insult, or exclude someone based on who they are. Our goal is to be a welcoming space, and this behavior directly undermines that.
- **Enforced In:** Discord Server, Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Using racial, homophobic, or transphobic slurs.
  - Making derogatory jokes about a specific religion or nationality.
  - Refusing to interact with someone because of their gender or sexual orientation.

# Respect and Common Courtesy

All members must treat each other with respect, even during disagreements. Engage in discussions in good faith and avoid personal attacks. Harassment, bullying, belittling, or intimidating other users is strictly forbidden.

- **What this means:** You can disagree with an idea, but you cannot attack the person. Focus on the topic, not on insulting the individual you are talking to.
- **Enforced In:** Discord Server, Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - "That's a stupid idea, you don't know what you're talking about."
  - Repeatedly messaging a user who has asked you to stop.

# Profanity and Derogatory Language

General profanity (cursing) is allowed in moderation. However, using profanity, slurs, or any derogatory terms to insult, attack, or degrade another user is strictly prohibited.

- **What this means:** The context of your language matters. Swearing out of frustration is different from swearing at someone to hurt them. All slurs are forbidden, regardless of intent or target.

  - Calling another user an insulting name combined with a curse word (e.g., "You're a f\*\*\*ing idiot").
  - Using any slur, even if directed at no one in particular.
  - Using derogatory terms related to mental health as an insult (e.g., calling something "r\*\*\*\*\*ed").

# Language

To ensure effective moderation and clear communication, this is an English-only server. Using other languages in public channels is not permitted.

# Personal Information (PII)

Protect your privacy and the privacy of others. Do not share Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on the server. This includes asking others for their PII.

# Discussion of Real-World Tragedies

Discussions about real-world tragedies and disasters are permitted, but they must be handled with maturity and respect for those affected.

# Political Discussions

To maintain a peaceful and focused community, discussions about real-world politics, political figures, and partisan debates are not allowed.

Do not publicly ask or pressure another user to move a conversation to Direct Messages (DMs). If two users mutually agree to talk privately, they may do so, but the invitation should not be made in a way that puts someone on the spot.

# Self-Promotion and Advertising

Users are prohibited from advertising or promoting their personal projects, social media, or other Discord communities without explicit permission from staff.

  - Sending unsolicited DMs to members with invites to another Discord server.

- **Enforced In:** Discord Server
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Posting memes or off-topic chatter in incorrect channels.
  - Holding a long, casual conversation in a channel meant for bot commands.
  - Asking for support in a general chat channel instead of opening a support ticket.

# Spamming and Flooding

Do not disrupt chat by spamming or flooding channels. This includes sending multiple messages in a row very quickly, posting large walls of text, or sending repetitive messages.

  - Sending the same message or image three or more times in a row.

# Mass Mentioning and Random Pinging

Do not ping (@mention) users who are not part of your current conversation or for no reason. Do not mass-mention multiple users.

- **What this means:** Pings send a notification and should only be used when you need someone's direct attention for a legitimate reason.
- **Enforced In:** Discord Server
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Pinging a staff member to say hello or ask a non-urgent question.
  - Pinging a random user to draw their attention to a meme or video.
  - Mentioning multiple users in a single message for no reason ("ghost pinging").

# Bypassing Filters

Attempting to bypass our automated word filters is strictly prohibited. The intent to use a forbidden word is treated the same as using the word itself.

- **What this means:** Our filters are in place for a reason. Trying to circumvent them shows a clear intent to break the rules.
- **Enforced In:** Discord Server, Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Adding symbols or spaces to a slur (e.g., "s l u r").
  - Using spoiler tags to hide a banned word.
  - Intentionally misspelling a derogatory term to avoid detection.

# Support Ticket Misuse

The support ticket system is for reporting rule violations, asking for staff assistance, or making serious inquiries. Misusing this system is not permitted.

- **What this means:** The ticket system is a direct line to staff members who volunteer their time. Please respect that by only using it for its intended purpose.
- **Enforced In:** Discord Server
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Opening a ticket to troll staff members or waste their time.
  - Making false reports against another user.
  - Spamming the ticket system by opening multiple tickets for the same issue.

# Disclosure of Classified Information

Members are prohibited from disclosing, or claiming to possess, classified or confidential information related to Valley Correctional Facility. This also includes knowing about the possession of such information by another member and not reporting it.

- **What this means:** Information about internal operations and staff discussions is to be kept private to ensure fairness. Leaking this information, pretending to have it, or saying you've been sent it can create distrust and disrupt the community.
- **Enforced In:** Everywhere
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Sharing screenshots from confidential staff or Department of Corrections channels.
  - Publicly claiming that you have access to or have been sent confidential information.
  - Hinting at sensitive staff discussions to cause drama or influence other members.

# Fail Roleplay (FRP)

Fail Roleplay occurs when a player's actions are unrealistic, nonsensical, or break the immersion of the prison environment. Your character should act in a way that is believable for their situation.

- **What this means:** You are roleplaying as a character within a correctional facility, not a superhero. Your actions should reflect a realistic understanding of your character's limitations and the environment's dangers.
- **Enforced In:** Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - An inmate walking up to a heavily armed Corrections Officer and showing no fear.
  - Claiming to have unrealistic abilities, such as breaking down a steel door with your bare hands.
  - Not roleplaying injuries after being tased or hit, and instead getting up instantly.

# Forbidden Roleplay Themes

Engaging in roleplay themes that are overly graphic, sexual, or based on sensitive real-world topics is strictly forbidden. This server must adhere to Roblox's Terms of Service and create a safe environment for all players.

- **What this means:** We have firm boundaries on roleplay topics. While this is a prison game, we do not permit extreme or degenerate roleplay that crosses into deeply uncomfortable or forbidden territory.
- **Enforced In:** Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Engaging in any form of romantic, intimate, or sexual roleplay (NSFW/Dating).
  - Graphically describing acts of torture or dismemberment in extreme detail.
  - Roleplaying large-scale, politically motivated attacks, or bomb threats (Terrorism).

# Baiting

Baiting is the act of intentionally provoking staff members (like Corrections Officers) with low-effort, unrealistic actions to get an out-of-character reaction, annoy them, or waste their time.

- **What this means:** Your in-character actions should have an in-character purpose. If you are trying to antagonize a CO, it should be part of a larger plan, not just because you are bored.
- **Enforced In:** Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Repeatedly pulling out a minor contraband item in front of a CO and quickly putting it away.
  - Running up to a CO, punching the air near them, and running away, over and over.
  - Intentionally breaking a minor rule in plain sight of an officer just to see if they will chase you.

# Intrusion and Forceful Roleplay

Do not force your way into a roleplay scene that you are not a part of. If a scene is taking place in a private area or between specific individuals, you must have a valid in-character reason to join.

- **What this means:** Respect the stories other players are trying to build. Interrupting a private or focused scene can ruin the experience for those involved.
- **Enforced In:** Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Walking into an interrogation room and starting a random, unrelated conversation.
  - Joining a fight between two inmates that you have no in-character connection to.
  - Interjecting yourself into a medical scene in which you aren't involved.

# Powergaming

Powergaming is forcing actions upon another player without giving them a chance to react, or creating a character that is unrealistically powerful or "invincible."

- **What this means:** You only control your own character's actions and attempts. You cannot decide the outcome for another player. Roleplay is cooperative, not a competition.
- **Enforced In:** Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Roleplaying an action's outcome instead of the attempt (e.g., "tackles the inmate" instead of "attempts to tackle the inmate").
  - Claiming your character dodges every single attack or is immune to tasers.
  - Roleplaying that you single-handedly take down five armed officers without a scratch.

# Metagaming

Metagaming is using knowledge that you, the player, have out-of-character (OOC) to give your in-character (IC) person an unfair advantage.

- **What this means:** You must separate what YOU know from what your CHARACTER knows. Your character should only know what they have learned through in-game roleplay.
- **Enforced In:** Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Learning about a planned riot via Discord DM and having your CO character prepare for it in-game.
  - Seeing an inmate's username and immediately knowing their gang affiliation without any prior in-character interaction.
  - Glitching your camera into a room to see or hear a private conversation.

# In-Game Trolling

Trolling is the act of intentionally disrupting the game and ruining the roleplay experience for others with malicious intent. This goes beyond simple rule-breaking and is a deliberate attempt to cause chaos.

- **What this means:** While Fail RP can be accidental, trolling is a conscious choice to be disruptive.
- **Enforced In:** Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Spamming tool sounds or animations during a serious roleplay scene.
  - Abusing game physics to glitch through walls or fly.
  - Following other players around while breaking character to annoy them.

# Non-Compliance with Staff

Refusing to follow a direct, out-of-character order from a server Moderator is a serious offense.

- **What this means:** This rule is about moderator instructions, not in-character orders from a CO. When a staff member with an "Administrator" tag speaks to you OOC, their instruction is final.
- **Enforced In:** Shift
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Ignoring a moderator who tells you to stop breaking a rule.
  - Leaving the game or resetting your character to avoid a moderator who has frozen you.
  - Arguing with a staff member's decision in a public channel instead of using the proper appeal process.

# Voice Channel Conduct

All rules that apply to text channels are also in full effect within our voice channels. All members are expected to be courteous and avoid intentionally disrupting the flow of conversation.

- **What this means:** Any behavior that would be a violation in text chat is also a violation in voice chat. You should be mindful of your microphone and actions to avoid preventing others from speaking or enjoying the channel.
- **Enforced In:** Discord Server
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Verbally insulting, belittling, or yelling at another user.
  - Intentionally creating loud static, blowing into your microphone, or screaming (Mic Spamming).
  - Constantly and deliberately interrupting other users or talking over them.

# Soundboard Usage

The Discord soundboard feature is available for occasional and appropriate use. It should not be used to disrupt conversations or introduce inappropriate content.

- **What this means:** A well-timed sound effect can be funny, but spamming it ruins the experience for everyone. All sounds must adhere to our server's content guidelines.
- **Enforced In:** Discord Server
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Repeatedly playing the same sound effect back-to-back.
  - Using sound clips that contain slurs, sexually explicit audio, or slurs.
  - Playing extremely loud sounds designed to hurt other users' ears (ear rape).

# Voice Channel Activities

Discord Activities (such as Watch Together, Sketch Heads, etc.) may only be launched and used while a member of our moderation staff is present and actively supervising the session.

- **What this means:** This rule ensures that any content shared during an activity is appropriate and follows all server rules. Unsupervised sessions can easily lead to the sharing of inappropriate videos or links.
- **Enforced In:** Discord Server
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Starting a "Watch Together" session without a moderator present to supervise.
  - Refusing to end an Activity when requested by a staff member.
  - Playing videos that violate server rules during a supervised session.
