## Overview

Our community runs shifts that allow everyone to participate in a private server managed by our team. During these shifts, the experience significantly differs from that of a public servers. We emphasize roleplay in our shifts, setting us apart from public servers. Additionally, we limit team access, allowing only the inmate team to be public and accessible to all members.
