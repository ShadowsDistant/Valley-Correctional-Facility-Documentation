<Card title="Fail Roleplay" icon="mask">
  Fail Roleplay occurs when a player's actions are unrealistic, nonsensical, or break the immersion of the prison environment. Your character should act in a way that is believable for their situation.

  - **What this means:** You are roleplaying as a character within a correctional facility, not a superhero or a cartoon. Your actions should reflect a realistic understanding of your character's limitations and the environment's dangers. Consistently acting out of character breaks the experience for everyone.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - An inmate walking up to a heavily armed Corrections Officer (CO) and showing no fear or concern for their safety.
    - Claiming to have unrealistic abilities, such as being able to break down a steel door with your bare hands or phase through walls.
    - Not roleplaying injuries. If you are tased or hit with a baton, your character should react appropriately instead of instantly getting up and running away at full speed.
    - Randomly starting to dance or use out-of-place emotes during a serious situation, like a lockdown or a riot.
</Card>

<Card title="Inappropriate Roleplay" icon="hand">
  Engaging in roleplay themes that are overly graphic, sexual, or based on sensitive real-world topics is strictly forbidden. This server must adhere to Roblox's Terms of Service and create a safe environment for all players.

  - **What this means:** We have firm boundaries on roleplay topics. While this is a prison game, we do not permit extreme or degenerate roleplay that crosses into deeply uncomfortable or forbidden territory.
  - **Examples of forbidden themes:**
    - **NSFW/Dating:** Any form of romantic, intimate, or sexual roleplay is prohibited.
    - **Excessive Gore:** You can roleplay a fight, but avoid describing it in extreme, graphic detail (e.g., describing dismemberment or torture). Keep it within reasonable limits (e.g., "_throws a punch to the jaw_").
    - **Terrorism:** Roleplaying large-scale, politically-motivated attacks, bomb threats, or hostage situations that mimic real-world terrorism.
    - **Drug Usage:** Roleplaying the graphic creation or use of narcotics is not allowed. While contraband may be a theme, detailed depictions of substance abuse are forbidden.
    - **Real-World Politics:** Do not bring real-world political figures, parties, or ideologies into roleplay.
</Card>

<Card title="Baiting" icon="steak">
  Baiting is the act of intentionally provoking staff members (like Corrections Officers) with low-effort, unrealistic actions to get an out-of-character reaction. The goal of baiting is typically to annoy staff or waste their time, not to create meaningful roleplay.

  - **What this means:** Your in-character actions should have an in-character purpose. If you are trying to antagonize a CO, it should be part of a larger plan (like creating a distraction), not just because you are bored.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Repeatedly pulling out a minor contraband item in front of a CO and quickly putting it away.
    - Running up to a CO, punching the air near them, and running away, over and over.
    - Intentionally breaking a minor rule in plain sight of an officer just to see if they will chase you.
</Card>

<Card title="Interfering" icon="people">
  Do not force your way into a roleplay scene that you are not a part of. If a scene is taking place in a private area or is clearly between specific individuals, you must have a valid in-character reason to join.

  - **What this means:** Respect the stories other players are trying to build. Interrupting a private or focused scene can ruin the experience for those involved.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Walking into an interrogation room while a CO is questioning an inmate and starting a random, unrelated conversation.
    - Joining a fight between two inmates that you have no in-character connection to, simply because you want to fight.
    - Running up to a scene and asking "What's going on?" out of character.
</Card>

<Card title="Powergaming" icon="fire">
  Powergaming is forcing actions upon another player without giving them a chance to react, or creating a character that is unrealistically powerful or "invincible." Roleplay is cooperative, not a competition to "win."

  - **What this means:** You only control your own character's actions and attempts. You cannot decide the outcome for another player.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - **Forcing an action:** Instead of typing "_tackles the inmate and puts him in cuffs_," you should type "**_attempts_**_ to tackle the inmate._" This gives the other player a chance to roleplay their response.
    - **Roleplaying an invincible character:** Your character cannot dodge every single attack, be immune to tasers, or single-handedly take down five armed officers without a scratch. Your character must have realistic weaknesses and limitations.
</Card>

<Card title="Metagaming" icon="laptop">
  Metagaming is using knowledge that you, the player, have out-of-character (OOC) to give your in-character (IC) person an unfair advantage. Your character should only know what they have learned through in-game roleplay.

  - **What this means:** You must separate what YOU know from what your CHARACTER knows.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Your friend tells you in a Discord DM that their gang is planning a riot at noon. You cannot have your CO character prepare for a riot at noon without first learning that information in-character (e.g., from an informant).
    - You see an inmate's username and customized gang uniform and immediately know which gang they are in, even though your character has never met them or heard of their gang before.
    - Seeing a player's nametag through a wall due to a Roblox glitch and using that information to avoid them or track them down.
</Card>

<Card title="Trolling" icon="ghost">
  Trolling is the act of intentionally disrupting the game and ruining the roleplay experience for others with malicious intent. This goes beyond simple rule-breaking and is a deliberate attempt to cause chaos.

  - **What this means:** While Fail RP can be accidental, trolling is a conscious choice to be disruptive.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - Spamming tool sounds during a serious roleplay scene.
    - Abusing game physics to glitch through walls.
    - Following other players around, breaking character, and making annoying comments or sounds to disrupt their RP.
</Card>

<Card title="Non-Compliance" icon="person">
  Non-Compliance is refusing to follow a direct, out-of-character order from a server Moderator. This is a serious offense.

  - **What this means:** This rule is about moderator instructions, NOT in-character orders from a CO. When a staff member with a "Administrator" tag speaks to you in an OOC capacity (e.g., via private message or a staff command), their instruction is final and is meant to resolve a rule-breaking situation. Administrator may also be invisible, but can be identifiyed by the yellow neon cuffs.
  - **Examples of violations:**
    - A moderator tells you to "Stop Fail RPing," and you ignore them and continue.
    - A moderator "freezes" or "jails" your character to speak with you about a rule break, and you leave the game or reset your character to avoid them.
    - Arguing with a staff member's decision in a public channel instead of using the proper channels to appeal or discuss it.
