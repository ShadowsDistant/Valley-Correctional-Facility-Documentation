# Transparency Report: Recent Events & The Path Forward

<Card title="A Message from the New Administration" icon="bullhorn">
  In this report, we will explain recent events and internal issues that transpired within our team and address the change in administration. The actions of the previous team were not acceptable, and we know we could have done better.

  Over the next few days, the new management will be reviewing all policies, bans, applications, and suggestions. We will also be implementing changes that we hope will prevent situations like this from occurring again. We hope this report begins to repair the trust we have lost and proves our commitment to making VCF the best it can be.

## Addressing Community Concerns

We will now address the specific concerns raised in the recent faction report. Our comments are limited to issues directly related to VCF operations.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Concern: 'Jesus Christ Event'" icon="cross">
    **Our Comment:** I will fully admit that I was a participant in this event, which I now realize was not appropriate. While the event wasn't mocking religion, having a user play the role of a religious figure was unacceptable.

    **Resolution:** To address this, we are immediately implementing a **zero-tolerance policy on all religious roleplay** to ensure this does not happen again. I personally apologize for my involvement. More information about this new rule will be released when it is enacted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concern: Wrongful Terminations of DoC High Command" icon="user-slash">
    **Our Comment:** When the previous owner was removed, several DoC high command members either resigned or were terminated. Terminations were issued after key operational documents were privatized and communication with the new administration ceased. While we understand the documents were their own, this action was unprofessional and disruptive.

    **Resolution:** In the future, all terminations of high command members will be formally reviewed by the **Specialized Investigations Division (SID)** to ensure strict standards are met. Anyone terminated during this period may open a ticket to request a formal review of their case by SID.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concern: Chaotic Shifts" icon="tornado">
    **Our Comment:** The evidence presented showed a clip of a shift that took place during the administrative transition. Due to the lack of DoC leadership at that time, we were unable to host civilized shifts. We should have canceled all shifts until replacements were found.

    **Resolution:** We will be improving our shift management protocols to ensure that a lack of departmental leadership will result in the temporary suspension of shifts, not a decline in their quality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Concern: Lack of Effort from Staff" icon="chart-line-down">
    **Our Comment:** A report showed that some staff members had processed zero whitelist applications. I can confirm this was the case for me, as I had asked to be removed from that duty and was also managing the start of my school semester. However, I was actively handling tickets and attending shifts.

    **Resolution:** To ensure all staff members are contributing effectively, we will be reviewing the possibility of implementing a fair and reasonable **activity and work quota** for all moderators.
  </Accordion>

## A New Direction for VCF

Due to recent events, Valley Prison's management has appointed me as the new owner of VCF. I agree with their decision and plan on making significant changes to ensure this cycle of new ownership ends.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Strengthening Our Team" icon="users">
    We will be forming a new **advisory council** made up of experts in community management and internal affairs. This will ensure future decisions are well-informed and benefit the community.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connection with Valley Prison" icon="link">
    We are strengthening our connection by allowing Valley Prison staff to moderate our server. Their moderators will also have access to an "Anytime Application" for our team, regardless of public application status.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operational Delays" icon="hourglass-half">
    During this transition, operations such as moderator application reviews, HSU leadership hiring, and some tickets have been delayed. We apologize and expect to resume all operations within the coming days.
  </Card>

## Action Plan for Prevention & Improvement

To prevent a situation like this from happening again, we are implementing the following changes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implement SID Oversight">
    Terminations for high-ranking DoC officials will now require a formal review by SID.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enhance Communication & Feedback">
    We are establishing an internal suggestions system for staff, open communication channels with Faction Auditors, and weekly/bi-weekly meetings for all teams.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Increase Transparency">
    Official transparency reports for internal issues will be released to keep the community aware.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conduct Formal Reviews">
    We will conduct a formal review of all previous bans, the moderation handbook, and staff permissions to ensure quality and fairness.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Improve Community & Shift Quality">
    We are cracking down on fail roleplay, implementing the ban on religious roleplay, and will begin hosting our first official gamenight.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Card title="What's Next" icon="arrow-right-to-arc">
  As we move forward, you may notice changes to rank titles and team structures. This incident, while unfortunate, is a critical learning experience. With these changes, we hope to see the community grow and thrive, leaving this chapter in the past as we work to address the root issues.

  If you have a question or comment, please open a ticket, and we will do our best to respond as quickly as possible.
