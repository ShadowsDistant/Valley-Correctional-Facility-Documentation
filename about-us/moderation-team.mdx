# Overview

Our Moderation team is built of community members who have either been handpicked to help moderate our community or who have passed our extensive application and interview process. Moderators are meant to help moderate content and behavior in our community while also making sure our community remains active, fun, safe, and engaging.

# Rule Enforcement

Our moderators have specific rules that they are obligated to enforce, but our moderators may take action against any user whose behavior or conduct is a violation of our rules, Discord's ToS, Roblox's community standards, or Valley Prison's rules.

# Becoming A Moderator

<Card title="Application" icon="notebook" href="https://melon.ly/form/7377847792229683200" cta="Apply now">
  Community members are offered the chance to complete our moderation application, which is an extensive application that tests the knowledge and experience of applicants. After completing the application, if you are accepted, you will undergo an interview with our Community Coordinators and our Prison Administration team. We ask that if you are not willing to take part in an interview, you don't complete an application. Applications are only released when moderators are needed, and will usually close within 72 hours.

<Card title="Interview" icon="microphone">
  If you apply to become a moderator via an application, our team will schedule an interview with you if you successfully pass the application. During the interview, you will be asked a series of questions about how you would handle certain situations, your experience, what you hope to accomplish as a moderator, and how you stand out from the crowd.

  We ask that you ensure that you have a working microphone so that we can clearly hear you speak. We also encourage you to bring some of your own questions! If you are worried about this part of the process, don't be. We don't expect you to come up with split-second answers, and we also don't expect all of your answers to be perfect. All we ask is that you try your best and answer all of our questions.
