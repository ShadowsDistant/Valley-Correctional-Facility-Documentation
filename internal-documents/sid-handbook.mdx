# Overview

**Division Lead:** `shadowsdistant`\
**Full Name:** `Specialized Investigations Division`\
**Abbreviation:** `SID`\
**Subdivisions:** `N/A`

This handbook goes over investigations along with the general operations of SID. This department is designed to stop security threats and abuse.

## Violations

Below is a list of violations that warrant an investigation and possible punishment. Ensure to read them carefully to ensure you're making the right choice.

### Command Abuse

Command Abuse is when a moderator is caught abusing commands and permissions granted to them. This includes the abuse of commands in a shift and on our Discord.

### Failure To Moderate

Failure to moderate occurs when a moderator sees or gets a report about a possible rule violation and fails to investigate the report or take action. This also includes failing to hand out the correct punishment.

### Biased Moderation

Biased Moderation is when a moderator makes a biased moderation decision. Moderators are to refer matters in which they may have biases to another moderator.

### Failure To Uphold Rules

Failure To Uphold Rules is when a moderator fails to follow our community rules, Valley Prison's rules, Roblox's Community Standards, or Discord Terms of Service.

### Failure To Follow Directive

Failure To Follow a Directive is when a moderator receives an order or command from a superior and fails to follow it.

### Inactivity

Inactivity is when a moderator is marked inactive by Melonly. This occurs when they have not started a shift in 14 days.

### Disclosure Of Classified Information

Disclose of Classified Information is when a moderator releases, shares, copies, or otherwise publicizes information that is classified.

## Point System

The point system is how moderators on our team are punished. Each violation will contain a point value. Which will be added to the moderator's record. Based on how many points they have, a certain action will be taken.

- **1st Point:** Verbal Warning
- **2nd Point:** Verbal Warning
- **3rd Point:** 7 Day Suspension
- **4th Point:** 14 Day Suspension
- **5th Point:** Termination

If a moderator gets above 5 points, they are to be terminated and blacklisted from ever reapplying.

## Investigating Violation

When conducting an investigation, investigators must remain unbiased in their approach and decision-making. And if needed, transfer the investigation to another investigator. Investigations should not be random and should only be started when an investigator has a reasonable suspicion that a violation may or has occurred. In such a case, investigators should collect relevant evidence, interview possible witnesses, and log other evidence such as:

- Command Logs
- Chat Logs
- Audit Logs

Investigators should make every attempt to ensure that their investigation stays private and classified until it is completed. During this time, investigators should compile what they have found into a document that clearly and accurately lays out the investigation.

### Step-By-Step

Notice a possible rule violation by a moderator, investigators are not allowed to randomly start investigations without proof that one may or has been committed.

Collect evidence such as witness statements, chat logs, command logs, audit logs, or any other evidence that is relevant.

Compile a document that contains your evidence, your statement, what the moderator is being accused of, and the final determination.

Release your compiled report to the rest of the Management Division. And issue the punishment to the moderator using Melonly.

### Appealing A Decision

A moderator will be allowed up to 7 days to request an appeal of a decision. In which case, a senior investigator should review the investigation report and make a final decision on whether or not the evidence and punishment are fit. Moderators may only request one appeal per investigation; this only includes appeals that have been decided on by an investigator (i.e, completed appeals process). Moderators may also choose to provide evidence to the contrary.

To request an appeal, a moderator must use Melonly and answer all questions truthfully and fully on the appeal form. Appeals may be rejected if they don't meet this initial requirement (but should not lock the appeal from submitting another appeal).

### HR Investigations

Any investigations that involve a member of Valley Correctional Facility's high command. Which includes:

- Community Manager
- Internal Operations Manager
- Depertmental Operations Manager
- Chief of Security
- Community Coordinator

Must have the investigation approved by no less than 2 senior investigators along with the lead investigator, unless one of the investigators is in the investigation, in which case only one other investigator needs to approve it. This is to ensure that punishments of high-ranking individuals are fair and complete.

### Suspension

When a moderator is placed on suspension, they are to be stripped of any roles that are apart of the moderation team in both servers. They should not recieve commands during shifts. And should be removed from any internal communications while suspended.

### Termination

When a moderator is terminated, they are to lose all of their roles assoisated with the moderation team, along with access to the DoC server (unless they are a DoC member) and any internal communications.

## Rank Structure

SID has a special rank structure to ensure that investigations are conducted in a fair and unbiased manner.

### Lead Investigator

Oversees all investigations and manages the department and its employees. They ensure that the department's operations meet our standards and that punishments are fairly handed out.

### Senior Investigator

A senior investigator carries out normal investigations but has the additional job of reviewing punishment appeals. Senior investigators are more experienced than investigators and may be selected due to more high-profile investigations.

### Investigator

Investigators are the main force that carries out the majority of investigations. Helping us ensure the moderators are held accountable for their actions.

### Specialist Advisor

Specialist advisors are not investigators, but they advise on investigations in which their expertise is requested. They also advise on the handbook and policy decisions.

## Areas Of Investigation (AOI)

SID has a limited scope of investigatable offenses. These areas include:

- Any violation committed by a moderator
- Any violation of leaking classified materials (Includes community members)
- Any member who abandons their post (Including DoC and moderators)

SID may also conduct investigations into community members or players who are suspected of colluding against any member of the Management Division. The Lead Investigator may also launch an investigation into any other offense that might have relevance to SID AOI.

## Investigation Operations

SID will occasionally conduct investigative operations. The goal is to learn about suspected rule violations and other information that falls under the AOI. Each operation requires the approval of the Lead Investigator, and each investigative operation should have the following:

- No more than 5 involved investigators
- A codename for the operation
- A group chat with the involved investigators
- A clear mission/goal for the investigation

These operations should target players who violate our rules or members who cannot be trusted with classified information.

### Guardrails

Investigators are not allowed to engage in rule violations within an operation. As an example, if you are attempting to find a member who would accept classified materials, you may **NOT** send them classified information. However, you may send them fake documents.

## Investigator Punishments

As an investigator you are held to the highest standards. Unlike the moderation team which has 5 points until termination. SID allows for **ONE** verbal warning, **ONE** suspension (any length) and finally termination. Investigators are held to the same regulations as moderators. The Lead Investigator may dismiss any member of the SID for any reason at any time.

## Confidentiality Agreement

Any member of the SID automatically agrees to follow this agreement or be subject to immediate termination without an appeal and a blacklist from all positions.

SID Investigators may not share, release, discuss, or publish any classified information. Including information about an investigation, investigative operation, past investigations, punishments, chats regarding SID, chats within the moderation category, chats with the DoC server, chats with the Management Division regarding official matters with anyone who doesn't have the basis to know.

If you are unsure if something is classified and who it can be shared with contact the Lead Investigator.
