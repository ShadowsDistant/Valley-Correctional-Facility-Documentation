## Code of Conduct Violations

The following sections detail the specific violations that fall under the jurisdiction of the SID.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Command Abuse" icon="terminal">
    Command Abuse is the intentional or negligent misuse of administrative commands or permissions for purposes other than their intended function. This violation is considered a significant breach of trust.

    - **Examples include, but are not limited to:**
      - Using commands (`:kick`, `:softban`) to target a user out of personal bias.
      - Teleporting or otherwise interfering with users for personal entertainment.
      - Granting permissions or roles to unauthorized individuals.
      - Using moderation tools to evade in-game consequences.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failure to Moderate" icon="eye-slash">
    Failure to Moderate occurs when a staff member knowingly and willfully ignores a violation of community rules they are responsible for enforcing. This includes neglecting reports or failing to apply the correct and proportional punishment.

    - **Clarifications:**
      - This does not apply if a staff member is legitimately occupied, but they are expected to return to the issue or refer it to another moderator.
      - Consistently handing out punishments significantly more lenient than prescribed guidelines constitutes this violation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Biased Moderation" icon="scale-unbalanced">
    Biased Moderation is the act of allowing personal feelings, relationships, or prejudices to influence administrative decisions. All staff are required to act as impartial arbiters of the rules.

    - **Examples include, but are not limited to:**
      - Giving a friend a lighter punishment (or no punishment) for an offense.
      - Applying a harsher punishment to a user due to a personal dislike.
      - Refusing to investigate a report against a friend or colleague.
    - **Conflict of Interest Protocol:** Staff must formally recuse themselves from any situation where bias could be perceived by notifying another moderator.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failure to Uphold Community Standards" icon="book-bookmark">
    This violation occurs when a staff member breaches the established rules of the community, Valley Prison, Roblox's Community Standards, or Discord's Terms of Service. As representatives of the staff team, they are held to the highest standard of behavior, both on and off duty.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failure to Follow a Directive" icon="person-arrow-down-to-line">
    This violation, also known as insubordination, occurs when a staff member receives a clear, legitimate, and lawful order from a superior and fails to execute it.

    - **Clarifications:**
      - The directive must come from someone within their direct chain of command.
      - Staff may refuse a directive if it violates a handbook policy, but they must immediately report the directive to a higher-ranking individual or SID.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inactivity" icon="clock">
    Inactivity is defined as failing to meet the minimum required activity quotas without prior notification or an approved Leave of Absence (LOA). For moderation staff, this is triggered by failing to log a shift within a 14-day period as tracked by Melonly.

    - **LOA Protocol:** To avoid this, staff must formally request an LOA in advance for any extended period of absence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disclosure of Classified Information" icon="file-lock">
    This is a zero-tolerance violation. It involves the unauthorized sharing, leaking, copying, or publicizing of any information deemed classified.

    - **Classified information includes:**
      - Internal discussions within staff-only channels.
      - Details of ongoing or past SID investigations.
      - User punishment records and moderation history.
      - Any document marked as "Confidential" or "Internal Use Only."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mismanagement" icon="users-slash">
    Mismanagement is the failure of a staff member in a supervisory or leadership position to properly manage their team or responsibilities, leading to a breakdown in operations, team morale, or enforcement.

    - **Examples include, but are not limited to:**
      - Ignoring internal complaints or issues from their team members.
      - Making strategic decisions that are demonstrably harmful to the department.
      - Showing clear favoritism in promotions, assignments, or punishments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Disciplinary Point System

<Card title="How the Point System Works" icon="scale-balanced">
  This system assigns points to staff members for confirmed violations. Points are cumulative across all violation types and are used to determine the appropriate disciplinary action. For example, receiving 1 point for "Inactivity" and later 2 points for "Failure to Moderate" will result in a total of 3 active points, triggering a 7-Day Suspension. This ensures that a pattern of misconduct, even across different areas, is addressed appropriately.
</Card>

### Violation Point Values

The number of points assigned for a violation is determined by its severity and impact. The Lead Investigator reserves the right to adjust points based on the specific context of an incident.

| Violation                           | Points Assigned                                        |
| :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inactivity**                      | **1 Point**                                            |
| **Failure to Follow Directive**     | **1 Point**                                            |
| **Failure to Moderate**             | **2 Points**                                           |
| **Failure to Uphold Standards**     | **1-3 Points** <br /> _(Value determined by severity)_ |
| **Biased Moderation**               | **3 Points**                                           |
| **Mismanagement**                   | **4 Points** & Demotion                                |
| **Command Abuse (Minor/Negligent)** | **4 Points**                                           |
| **Command Abuse (Major/Malicious)** | **6 Points** _(Triggers immediate termination)_        |
| **Disclosure of Classified Info**   | **6 Points** _(Triggers immediate termination)_        |

### Punishment Thresholds

As points accumulate, they trigger corresponding disciplinary actions.

| Total Active Points | Disciplinary Action                       |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| **1 Point**         | Formal Verbal Warning                     |
| **2 Points**        | Final Verbal Warning                      |
| **3 Points**        | 7-Day Suspension                          |
| **4 Points**        | 14-Day Suspension                         |
| **5 Points**        | 14-Day Suspension & Final Warning         |
| **6+ Points**       | **Termination** & Blacklist Consideration |

## Key Policies & Clarifications

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Point Expiration" icon="hourglass-end">
    To allow for staff improvement, points are not permanent. Each point will automatically expire **6 months** after the date it was issued, provided no further violations occur in that period.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Investigator's Discretion" icon="user-secret">
    For violations with a point range (like "Failure to Uphold Standards"), the final point value will be determined by the investigating SID member and approved by the Lead Investigator based on the evidence and impact.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero-Tolerance Violations" icon="ban">
    Violations worth 6 points, such as "Disclosure of Classified Information," are considered zero-tolerance offenses. They bypass the lower steps of the disciplinary ladder and result in immediate termination.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Standard Investigative Procedure

All investigations must be conducted with impartiality, thoroughness, and discretion.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiation">
    An investigation begins only after receiving a credible report or having a reasonable suspicion supported by preliminary evidence. Random or "fishing" investigations are strictly prohibited.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evidence Collection">
    Investigators must collect all relevant evidence (logs, recordings, statements) and preserve it in its original, unaltered state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Documentation">
    A formal, secure report is compiled containing the allegation(s), all collected evidence, interview summaries, and a concluding statement with a recommended punishment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conclusion & Action">
    The final report is submitted to the Lead Investigator for review. Upon approval, the finding is delivered to the staff member, and the punishment is officially logged and executed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Governance & Policies

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Appeals Process" icon="file-signature">
    Staff members have **7 calendar days** to request an appeal via Melonly. Appeals must be based on new exculpatory evidence, a clear procedural error, or a grossly disproportionate punishment. The decision of the appellate reviewer is final.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Command Investigations" icon="user-shield">
    Any investigation targeting a member of High Command requires formal approval from the Lead Investigator and at least one other Senior Investigator to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure a fair and complete process.
