### Command Abuse

Command Abuse is when a moderator is caught abusing commands and permissions granted to them. This includes the abuse of commands in a shift and on our Discord.

### Failure To Moderate

Failure to moderate occurs when a moderator sees or gets a report about a possible rule violation and fails to investigate the report or take action. This also includes failing to hand out the correct punishment.

### Biased Moderation

Biased Moderation is when a moderator makes a biased moderation decision. Moderators are to refer matters in which they may have biases to another moderator.

### Failure To Uphold Rules

Failure To Uphold Rules is when a moderator fails to follow our community rules, Valley Prison's rules, Roblox's Community Standards, or Discord Terms of Service.

### Failure To Follow Directive

Failure To Follow a Directive is when a moderator receives an order or command from a superior and fails to follow it.

### Inactivity

Inactivity is when a moderator is marked inactive by Melonly. This occurs when they have not started a shift in 14 days.

## Point System

The point system is how moderators on our team are punished. Each violation will contain a point value. Which will be added to the moderator's record. Based on how many points they have, a certain action will be taken.

- **1st Point:** Verbal Warning
- **2nd Point:** Mandatory Retraining
- **3rd Point:** 14 Day Mandatory Supervision & Retraining
- **4th Point:** 7 Day Suspension, Mandatory Retraining, 14 Day Mandatory Supervision
- **5th Point:** 14 Day Suspension, Mandatory Retraining, 30 Day Mandatory Supervision
- **6th Point:** Termination

If a moderator gets above 6 points, they are to be terminated and blacklisted from ever reapplying.

## Investigating Violation

Only specific individuals within the Valley Correctional Facility community have the special job of conducting investigations into moderators. This includes the following ranks:

- Warden
- Deputy Warden
- Assistant Warden.

When conducting an investigation, investigators must remain unbiased in their approach and decision-making. And if needed, transfer the investigation to another investigator. Investigations should not be random and should only be started when an investigator has a reasonable suspicion that a violation may or has occurred. In such a case, investigators should collect relevant evidence, interview possible witnesses, and log other evidence such as:

- Command Logs
- Chat Logs
- Audit Logs

Investigators should make every attempt to ensure that their investigation stays private and classified until it is completed. During this time, investigators should compile what they have found into a document which clearly and accurately lays out the investigation.

### Step-By-Step

<Steps>
  <Step title="Suspect Rule Violation">
    Notice a possible rule violation by a moderator, investigators are not allowed to randomly start investigations without proof that one may or has been committed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather Evidence">
    Collect evidence such as witness statements, chat logs, command logs, audit logs or any other evidence that is relevent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compile Report">
    Compile a document that contains your evidence, your statement, what the moderator is being accused of and the final determination.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Release Report & Finalize Punishment">
    Release your compiled report to the rest of the Prison Administration team. And issue the punishment to the moderator.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Appealing A Decision

A moderator will be allowed up to 7 days to request an appeal of a decision. In which case, another investigator should review the investigation report and make a final decision on whether or not the evidence and punishment are fit. Moderators may only request one appeal per investigation; this only includes appeals that have been decided on by an investigator (i.e, completed appeals process). Moderators may also choose to provide evidence to the contrary.

To request an appeal, a moderator must use Melonly and answer all questions truthfully and fully on the appeal form. Appeals may be rejected if they don't meet this initial requirement (but should not lock the appeal from submitting another appeal).

### HR Investigations

Any investigations that involve a member of Valley Correctional Facility's high command. Which includes:

- Warden
- Deputy Warden
- Assistant Warden
- Chief of Security
- Community Coordinator

Must have the investigation approved by the other two investigators, unless one of the investigators is in the investigation, in which case only one other investigator needs to approve it. This is to ensure that punishments of high-ranking individuals are fair and complete.
