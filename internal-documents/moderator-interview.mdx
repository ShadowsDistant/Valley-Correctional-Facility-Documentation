# Moderator Interview & Assessment Guide

## Interviewer Protocol

As an interviewer, you are the first line of quality control in our hiring process. Your professionalism and objectivity are paramount. Adhere strictly to the following protocols.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Core Principles" icon="list-check">
    - **Maintain Objectivity:** Base your assessment solely on the applicant's responses and qualifications, free from any personal bias.
    - **Allow Sufficient Response Time:** Give the applicant adequate time to formulate their thoughts, but gently guide the interview forward if needed.
    - **Stick to the Script:** Do not add, remove, or rephrase the official questions to ensure a fair and standardized process for all candidates.
    - **Provide Clarification:** If an applicant is confused, you may re-read the question for them, but do not provide hints or examples.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recording Policy" icon="microphone-lines">
    - **Recording is Mandatory:** All interviews **must** be recorded to serve as a crucial tool for quality assurance and review by the hiring committee.
    - **Obtain Consent:** You must obtain explicit consent to record at the very beginning of the interview.
    - **Refusal of Consent:** If an applicant objects, professionally inform them the interview cannot proceed and **end the call immediately.** This is an automatic withdrawal of their application.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation & Grading" icon="file-pen">
    - **Take Detailed Notes:** Use the official **Interview Grading Rubric** throughout the interview.
    - **Record Key Information:** Your notes should include direct quotes, summaries of answers, and any concerns you have.

    >
    > "Before we begin, I must inform you that this entire interview is being recorded for quality assurance and for review by our hiring committee. Do I have your consent to proceed with the recording?"

    <Warning>
      **WAIT FOR A CLEAR "YES".** If they say no, respond: "Understood. Unfortunately, as recording is a mandatory part of our process, I will have to end the interview here. Thank you for your interest." Then end the call and delete any partial recording.
    </Warning>
    > "Great, thank you.
    >
    > "Throughout this interview, I will be asking you a series of questions about your experience, skills, and understanding of the role. We ask that you answer each question fully and honestly to the best of your ability. Please be aware that the questions asked today are confidential and should not be shared with anyone.
    >
    > "Do you understand these expectations?"
    >
    > **(Wait for confirmation.)**
    >
    > "Perfect. Do you have any questions for me before we begin?"
    >
    > **(Answer any preliminary questions they may have, then proceed.)**
    >
    > "Alright, let's get started with the first question."
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Part 2: Interview Questions">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Question 1: Moderator Duties">
        **"To start, could you describe what duties you believe a moderator is responsible for, and what our expectations would be for someone in that role?"**

        <Info>
          **Looking For:** Mention of core duties like enforcing rules (in-game and Discord), handling tickets, and community engagement. Crucially, they should understand the _expectations_ tied to these duties: impartiality, professionalism, and timely responses.
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Question 2: Community Rules">
        **"Based on what you've seen, can you list a few of our community rules and explain why you feel they are important for maintaining a positive environment?"**

        <Info>
          **Looking For:** Correct identification of actual rules. Their explanation should show an understanding of the _purpose_ behind the rules (e.g., preventing toxicity, ensuring fairness, safety).
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Question 3: Moderator Characteristics">
        **"In your own words, what are the three most important characteristics of an effective moderator?"**

        <Info>
          **Looking For:** Answers that align with our core values established in the handbooks. Look for keywords like: **Impartiality/Fairness, Integrity, Professionalism, Communication, and Patience.**
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Question 4: Scenario - Biased Moderation">
        **"Here is a scenario: You are the only moderator online during a shift. You witness a good friend of yours breaking a minor community rule. How do you handle this situation?"**

        <Info>
          **Looking For:** A clear, non-negotiable answer. The applicant must state they would enforce the rule exactly as they would for any other community member. They should demonstrate an understanding that friendship cannot influence moderation. This directly tests their grasp of the "Biased Moderation" policy.
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Question 5: Confidentiality">
        **"As a moderator, you will handle sensitive user information and be part of private staff discussions. How do you view the responsibility of handling confidential information?"**

        <Info>
          **Looking For:** A zero-tolerance stance on leaking or sharing classified information. They should express a strong understanding that what happens in staff channels, tickets, and DMs is strictly private and that breaching this trust is a serious offense.
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Question 6: Strengths">
        **"What would you say is your greatest strength, and how would it benefit you as a moderator?"**

        <Info>
          **Looking For:** A genuine strength that is relevant to the role (e.g., "I am very patient when dealing with frustrated people," "I am a clear communicator," "I am very detail-oriented").
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Question 7: Weaknesses">
        **"Conversely, what is one of your weaknesses, and what steps do you actively take to improve upon it or prevent it from affecting your performance?"**

        <Info>
          **Looking For:** Self-awareness and a proactive mindset. A good answer identifies a real weakness and shows they have a strategy to manage it (e.g., "I sometimes get tunnel vision on a task, so I set reminders to check in with my team.").
        </Info>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Question 8: Experience">
        **"Describe any previous experience you have in a moderation or leadership role. What were your key responsibilities?"**

        <Info>
          **Looking For:** A clear and concise description of their past roles. This helps gauge their familiarity with moderation environments and responsibilities.
        </Info>
