# Conducting An Interview

An interview is a crucial part of hiring someone. In order to make sure that interviews are conducted fairly, here are some of the rules and guidelines.

1. Give the interviewees sufficient time to answer questions. This does not mean give them 5 minutes to come up with an answer.
2. Be unbiased in your review and grading of the interview.
3. Notify interviewees of problems with their responses.
4. Don't create your own questions. You are only supposed to read the questions listed below.

During the interview, you will use some sort of recording software to record the entire interview. You must be able to clearly hear both yourself and the interviewee in your recording. It is also highly recommended that you get a transcription of the interview. If the interviewee objects to being recorded, you must end the recording and delete it from your system. This is considered an instant denial and will result in the interviewee being unable to continue with the hiring process.

When you start the interview make sure that you take notes, and list down concerns about the applicants interview in the interview grading document. At the end of the interview you will be expected to have a completed grading document.
