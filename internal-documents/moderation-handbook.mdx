# Overview

**Division Lead:** `shadowsdistant`\
**Full Name:** `Moderation Division`\
**Abbreviation:** `MOD`\
**Subdivisions:** `N/A`

This handbook outlines the basic functions of the moderation team, along with the expectations and regulations enforced upon moderators.

## Assigned Duties

Moderators are assigned specific duties that they are required to carry out. This includes:

- **1.0:** Enforcing our rules and regulations within our Discord server
- **1.1:** Enforcing our rules and regulations within our shifts
- **1.2:** Enforcing Valley Prison's rules, Roblox's Community Standards, and Discord's Terms of Service
- **1.3:** Responding to tickets within the Discord server
- **1.4:** Handling ban appeals (Senior Moderator+)
- **1.5:** Maintaining a good standing relationship within Valley Prison
- **1.6:** Engage with community members
- **1.7:** Follow directives given by supervisors

Moderators who fail to execute and carry out their duties will be subject to internal investigations and possible removal from the team.

## Active Scene

During shifts, moderators who either have someone detained or are discussing a moderation matter with another player must do so in a mod scene. This means:

- **2.0:** Scenes should be conducted away from other players
  - Scenes should take place in areas where it's just you and the other player. Do not take your scene into a public space with others.
- **2.1:** Scenes should be located in areas where players are unlikely to move to
  - This means don't conduct scenes in parts of the prison where a roleplay scene may occur. Or an area in which players are highly likely to travel through
- **2.2:** Scenes should only involve relevant parties
  - Scenes should not include players who are not involved. However, you are allowed to bring players who are involved (such as the reporting player).

Following these guidelines ensures that players will not disrupt a mod scene and that discussions around the reason for the scene stay private.

## Support Tickets

Moderators are assigned to handle tickets that get opened within our Discord. We are handling a ticket we expect you to:

- **3.0:** Remain professional and respectful
- **3.1:** Maintain confidentiality (don't share what happens in a ticket, and don't share other classified material within a ticket)
- **3.2:** Try your best to answer questions

When handling a ticket, you should try your best to assist the user with their questions or problems. If you can't, you may contact another moderator for assistance. Moderators should try to answer tickets within 12 hours of one being opened.

## Employment Standards

As a member of our moderation team, you will be held to the following standards, both in our community and in Valley Prison.

- **4.0:** Maintain respectful discussion
- **4.1:** Refrain from using derogatory or demeaning comments or statements
- **4.2:** Refrain from sharing, posting, or discussing inappropriate or NSFW topics

If you are caught violating our employment standards, you risk being removed from our team. Make smart choices.

## Classified Information

At Valley Correctional Facility, the following materials are considered classified. And henceforth, should not be shared, discussed, displayed, etc, outside of the team.

- **5.0:** Chat messages within tickets
- **5.1:** Chat messages within the moderation category of channels
- **5.2:** Private DM's with other moderators, Specialized Investigation Division or the Management Division
- **5.3:** Private DM's with community members discussing moderation topics (such as a report)
- **5.4:** Player punishment records
- **5.5:** Internal documents
- **5.6:** Chat messages within the DoC Discord server

Any other document, communication, or discussion that is marked or deemed classified by a Community Coordinator+ also applies to this policy. Any moderator caught possessing classified information they shouldn't, even if they didn't obtain, may be subject to this policy.

## Moderation Commands
