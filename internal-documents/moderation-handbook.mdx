## Code of Conduct

Accepting a position in this division means you accept a higher standard of conduct. Your actions, on and off duty, reflect on the entire staff team.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

    - Refrain from using derogatory, demeaning, or inflammatory language.
    - Avoid public discussions about controversial or inappropriate (NSFW) topics.

  <Card title="Impartiality & Fairness" icon="scale-balanced">
    Your duty is to enforce the rules without personal bias.

    - **Biased Moderation is Strictly Prohibited:** All decisions must be based on evidence and established rules, not personal feelings or friendships.
    - **Conflict of Interest Protocol:** If you have a personal relationship with an individual involved in a violation, you **must** recuse yourself and notify another moderator.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integrity & Accountability" icon="stamp">
    The trust placed in you is paramount.

    - All moderators are subject to the policies outlined in the **SID Operations Handbook**.
    - Violations such as **Command Abuse, Failure to Moderate, or Biased Moderation** will be referred to SID for a formal investigation. It is your responsibility to be familiar with these definitions.
