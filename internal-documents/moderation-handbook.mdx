## Assigned Duties

Moderators are assigned specific duties that they are required to carry out. This includes:

- 1.0 Enforcing our rules and regulations within our Discord server
- 1.1 Enforcing our rules and regulations within our shifts
- 1.2: Enforcing Valley Prison's rules, Roblox's Community Standards and Discord's Terms of Service
- 1.3: Responsing to tickets within the Discord server
- 1.4: Handling ban appeals (Senior Moderator+)
- 1.5: Maintaining a good standing relationship within Valley Prison
- 1.6: Engage with community members
- 1.7: Follow directives given by supervisors

Moderators who fail to execute and carry out their duties will be subject to internal investigations and possible removal from the team.

## Active Scene

During shifts, moderators who either have someone detained or are discussing a moderation matter with another player must do so in a mod scene. This means:

- 2.0 Scenes should be conducted away from other players
  - Scenes should take place in areas where it's just you and the other player. Do not take your scene into a public space with others.
- 2.1 Scenes should be located in areas where players are unlikely to move to
  - This means don't conduct scenes in parts of the prison where a roleplay scene may occur. Or an area in which players are highly likely to travel through
- 2.2 Scenes should only involve relevant parties
  - Scenes should not include players that are not involved. However,
