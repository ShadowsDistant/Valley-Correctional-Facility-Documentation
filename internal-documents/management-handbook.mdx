## Core Principles of Management

Every manager is expected to govern themselves and their division according to these principles.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Leadership & Accountability" icon="stamp">
    As a manager, you are held to the absolute highest standard of conduct. You are subject to SID policies and are directly accountable for the performance, conduct, and morale of your division. Your role is to mentor, train, and take corrective action to ensure your team meets its objectives.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Strategic Oversight" icon="chess-board">
    Your role is not to micromanage, but to provide direction and remove obstacles. You must be an expert in your division's operations, including its handbooks and procedures, and regularly assess its effectiveness to develop strategies for improvement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inter-Divisional Collaboration" icon="handshake">
    No division operates in a vacuum. Smooth communication and collaboration are critical. Managers are expected to participate in regular leadership meetings and work constructively with one another to resolve cross-divisional issues.
