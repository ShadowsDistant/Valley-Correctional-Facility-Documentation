## Executive Authority

The Community Manager for VCF has Executive Authority powers within the Management Division. This allows them to oversee all divisions, regardless of membership within said division. It also allows them to create, enforce, remove, or modify rules and regulations along with internal policies. Executive Authority will not be used to micromanage divisions.

## Dismissal Policy

Members of the Management Division are subject to this dismissal policy. This allows a majority vote from other managers to remove another manager. It also allows the Community Manager to dismiss members of the Management Division for violations of our policies or mismanagement. This will only be used in extreme situations in which a vote would take too long or is unavailable.

_The Community Manager is not subject to the Dismissal Policy, unless under the order of Valley Prison Ownership._

## Scope Policy

Members of the Management Division are **ONLY** allowed to oversee the division in which they are a manager. Managers are allowed to hold supervisory positions in other divisions but are **NOT** allowed to control, manage, or oversee divisions that they aren't a part of. Managers are also **NOT** allowed to act as a member of a division they aren't a part of

**Example:** The manager for the Development Division **ISN'T** allowed to supervise, manage, or execute the duties of the Moderation Division unless they hold a position in said division.

_The Community Manager is not subject to the Scope Policy._
