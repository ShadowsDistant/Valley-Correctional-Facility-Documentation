<Warning>
  Text channel rules apply in voice channels, mandating respectful communication and interaction.
</Warning>

#### **General Conduct**

First and foremost, all rules that apply to our text channels are also in full effect within our voice channels. The medium of communication may be different, but our standards for respect, safety, and appropriate conduct remain the same.

- **What this means:** Any behavior that would get you warned or banned in text chat will also result in disciplinary action in voice chat.
- **Examples:**
  - **Discrimination:** Saying a racial slur or making homophobic remarks is treated with the same severity as typing it.
  - **Harassment:** Verbally insulting, belittling, or yelling at another user is a violation of our respect rules.
  - **Inappropriate Content:** Discussing graphic, sexual, or otherwise forbidden topics is not allowed.

#### **Soundboard Usage**

The Discord soundboard feature is available for occasional and appropriate use. It should not be used to disrupt conversations or introduce inappropriate content.

- **What this means:** A well-timed sound effect can be funny, but spamming it ruins the experience for everyone. All sounds must adhere to our server's content guidelines.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - **Spamming:** Repeatedly playing the same sound effect back-to-back or playing multiple sounds over someone while they are trying to speak.
  - **Inappropriate Sounds:** Using sound clips that contain slurs, sexually explicit audio, or extremely loud noises designed to hurt other users' ears (ear rape).

#### **Disruptive Behavior**

Voice channels are a shared space, and access to them is a privilege. All members are expected to be courteous and avoid intentionally disrupting the flow of conversation.

- **What this means:** You should be mindful of your microphone and your actions. Behavior that intentionally prevents others from speaking or enjoying the channel is prohibited.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - **Mic Spamming:** Intentionally creating loud static, blowing into your microphone, screaming, or playing loud background music that overpowers other speakers.
  - **Talking Over Others:** Constantly and deliberately interrupting other users, refusing to let them finish a sentence.
  - **Obnoxious Voice Changers:** Using a voice changer to an excessive degree where your speech is unintelligible or used specifically to annoy or mock another user.
  - **Channel Hopping:** Rapidly joining and leaving a voice channel to spam the entry/exit notification sounds.

#### **Voice Channel Activities**

Discord Activities (such as Watch Together, Sketch Heads, Blazing 8s, etc.) may only be launched and used while a member of our moderation staff is present and actively supervising the session.

- **What this means:** This rule is in place to ensure that any content shared during an activity, especially media-based ones like Watch Together, is appropriate and follows all server rules. Unsupervised sessions can easily lead to the sharing of inappropriate videos or links.
- **Procedure:**
  - Do not start an Activity on your own.
  - If you would like to begin an activity with a group, please ask a staff member who is present for permission and supervision. If no staff member is in the channel, you may open a support ticket to request one.
  - **Violation Example:** A user starting a "Watch Together" session and playing videos for others without a moderator present to approve the content.
