<Warning>
  We take action on Direct Messages between people in our community that violate these rules.
</Warning>

#### **Discrimination and Hate Speech**

This server is a community for everyone. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of discrimination or hate speech. This includes targeting individuals or groups based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, national origin, or personal beliefs.

- **What this means:** You cannot harass, insult, or exclude someone based on who they are. Our goal is to be a welcoming space, and this behavior directly undermines that.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Using racial, homophobic, or transphobic slurs.
  - Making derogatory jokes about a specific religion or nationality.
  - Refusing to interact with someone because of their gender or sexual orientation.
  - Using stereotypes to attack or belittle another member.

#### **Respect and Common Courtesy**

All members must treat each other with respect, even during disagreements. Engage in discussions in good faith and avoid personal attacks. Harassment, bullying, belittling, or intimidating other users is strictly forbidden.

- **What this means:** You can disagree with an idea, but you cannot attack the person. Focus on the topic, not on insulting the individual you are talking to.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - "That's a stupid idea, you don't know what you're talking about."
  - Repeatedly messaging a user who has asked you to stop.
  - Publicly shaming or mocking another member for their opinions or roleplay style.

**Profanity and Derogatory Language**

General profanity (cursing) is allowed in moderation. However, using profanity, slurs, or any derogatory terms to insult, attack, or degrade another user is strictly prohibited.

- **What this means:** The context of your language matters. Swearing out of frustration is different from swearing _at_ someone to hurt them. All slurs are forbidden, regardless of intent or target.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Calling another user an insulting name combined with a curse word (e.g., "You're a f\*\*\*ing idiot").
  - Using any slur, even if directed at no one in particular.
  - Using derogatory terms related to mental health as an insult (e.g., calling something "r\*\*\*\*\*ed").

#### **Language**

To ensure effective moderation and clear communication, this is an English-only server. Using other languages in public channels is not permitted.

- **What this means:** Our staff team can only enforce the rules if they can understand what is being said. This policy is in place to protect all members and ensure a safe environment.

#### **Ragebaiting and Trolling**

Do not deliberately post inflammatory, controversial, or off-topic messages with the primary intent of provoking other users into an emotional response. This includes trolling, sealioning, and bad-faith arguments.

- **What this means:** Don't start arguments for entertainment. All interactions should be genuine and constructive.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Making a controversial statements
  - Intentionally misrepresenting someone's point to make them angry.
  - Repeatedly "poking" at a user about a topic you know they are sensitive about.

#### **Personal Information (PII)**

Protect your privacy and the privacy of others. Do not share Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the server. This includes asking others for their PII.

- **What this means:** PII is any information that can be used to identify you in the real world. Sharing it can put you and others at risk.
- **Examples of PII:**
  - Full names, home addresses, phone numbers, or personal email addresses.
  - Photographs of yourself, your family, or your home.
  - Links to personal social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.).

#### **Threats, Blackmail, and Doxxing**

Any threat against another user is strictly forbidden. This includes threatening to reveal or distribute their private information (doxxing), blackmailing them for any reason, or making threats of real-world harm.

- **What this means:** This is a serious offense that creates a hostile and unsafe environment. All such threats will result in an immediate and permanent ban, and a report will be filed with the Discord Trust & Safety team.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Posting a users IP address (weather it's fake or not)
  - Posting a users location (weather it's fake or not)

#### **Inappropriate and NSFW Content**

Do not post content that is Not Safe For Work (NSFW) or gratuitously shocking. This rule applies to text, images, videos, and links.

- **Examples of forbidden content:**
  - Pornography or sexually explicit material.
  - Extreme or real-life gore, mutilation, or depictions of death.
  - Glorification or insensitive jokes about real-world tragedies (e.g., 9/11, mass shootings).

#### **Discussion of Real-World Tragedies**

Discussions about real-world tragedies and disasters are permitted, but they must be handled with maturity and respect for those affected.

- **What this means:** You can express sympathy or discuss factual information about an event. You cannot, however, use it as an opportunity to be insensitive, spread misinformation, or make jokes.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Sharing memes or jokes about the victims of a natural disaster.
  - Using a recent tragedy to push a political agenda.

#### **Political Discussions**

To maintain a peaceful and focused community, discussions about real-world politics, political figures, and partisan debates are not allowed.

- **What this means:** This server is for roleplaying and gaming, not for political arguments. These topics often lead to division and hostility, which we want to avoid.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Debating political parties, candidates, or recent elections.
  - Arguing about controversial legislation or political movements.

Do not post links that are unverified, suspicious, or malicious. All links are subject to review and may be automatically deleted by our moderation tools to protect our users.

  - Links to illegal software, pirated content, or scam websites.
  - Any link that prompts an automatic download of a file.

#### **Directing Users to DMs**

Do not publicly ask or pressure another user to move a conversation to Direct Messages (DMs). If two users mutually agree to talk privately, they may do so, but the invitation should not be made in a way that puts someone on the spot.

- **What this means:** This rule is to prevent harassment and unwanted private messages. Furthermore, please be aware that **the moderation team does not handle reports from DMs**, as we have no way to verify the content. For issues in DMs, please use Discord's built-in block and report functions.

#### **Self-Promotion and Advertising**

Users are prohibited from advertising or promoting their personal projects, social media, or other Discord communities without explicit permission from staff.

- **What this means:** This includes sending unsolicited links to your YouTube channel, Twitch stream, personal Discord server, or any product you are selling. Attempting to recruit members from Valley Correctional Facility to another community ("poaching") is strictly forbidden, especially for other prison roleplaying groups.

#### **Channel Misuse**

Please use channels for their designated purposes. Read the channel topic or check for a pinned message to understand what the channel is for.

- **What this means:** Keeping conversations organized makes the server easier to navigate for everyone.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Posting memes or off-topic chatter incorrect channels.
  - Holding a long, casual conversation in a channel meant for bot commands.
  - Asking for support in a general chat channel instead of opening a support ticket.

#### **Spamming and Flooding**

Do not disrupt chat by spamming or flooding channels. This includes sending multiple messages in a row very quickly, posting large walls of text, or sending repetitive messages.

- **Examples of violations:**
  - Sending the same message or image three or more times in a row.
  - Typing
  - One
  - Word
  - Per
  - Message.
  - Excessive use of emojis or copy-pasted ASCII art that disrupts conversation.

#### **Mass Mentioning and Random Pinging**

Do not ping (`@mention`) users who are not part of your current conversation or for no reason. Do not mass-mention multiple users.

- **What this means:** Pings send a notification and should only be used when you need someone's direct attention for a legitimate reason.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - `@StaffMember` just to say hello or ask a question that is not urgent.
  - `@RandomUser` Hey, look at this funny video.

#### **Bypassing Filters**

Attempting to bypass our automated word filters is strictly prohibited. The intent to use a forbidden word is treated the same as using the word itself.

- **What this means:** Our filters are in place for a reason. Trying to circumvent them shows a clear intent to break the rules.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Adding symbols or spaces to a slur (e.g., `s.l.u.r` or `$lur`).
  - Using spoiler tags to hide a banned word (`||slur||`).
  - Intentionally misspelling a derogatory term to avoid detection.

#### **Support Ticket Misuse**

The support ticket system is for reporting rule violations, asking for staff assistance, or making serious inquiries. Misusing this system is not permitted.

- **What this means:** The ticket system is a direct line to staff members who volunteer their time. Please respect that by only using it for its intended purpose.
- **Examples of violations:**
  - Opening a ticket to troll staff members or waste their time.
  - Making false reports against another user.
  - Spamming the ticket system by opening multiple tickets for the same issue.
