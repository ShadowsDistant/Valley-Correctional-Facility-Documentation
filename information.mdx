## Community F&Q

Below is a list of questions that community members frequently ask, along with the answers to them.

### How do I join shifts?

You can attend our shifts by visiting the [shifts channel](https://discord.com/channels/1345804368263385170/1345816347657113702). Make sure that you have read our [rules](/community-rules/our-rules) before you attend.

### How long do shifts usually last?

Most of our shifts usually run for 1 hour and 30 minutes. But there are some cases in which they may be shorter or longer.

### What timezone are shifts primarily hosted in?

Most of our shifts will be hosted in the EST timezone, but we plan on expanding this in the future.

### How do I become a CO?

To become a corrections officer and play on their team, you must complete the application for the position and be accepted. You can see when applications open in our [announcements channel](https://discord.com/channels/1345804368263385170/1345816347657113702).

### How do I join CERT/RIOT?

To join one of these divisions, you must first be a corrections officer. Applications for these positions will be announced on the DoC's Discord server.

### How can I appeal my ban in Valley Prison?

Unfortunately, we don't hold any power to unban you from Valley Prison. You can submit an appeal to their team by joining their [appeal server](https://discord.gg/dpPzyrb9Rq).

### How do I become a moderator?

To become a moderator for Valley Correctional Facility, you will need to submit an application and pass an interview. If our team thinks you would make a great addition to our team, you will be accepted! You can learn more about how to become a moderator [here](/about-us/moderation-division).

### How can I join the Sheriff's Office?

We don't offer the Sheriff's team in our community. However, you can join the Sheriff's Office by joining the [VCSO Discord](https://discord.gg/Z72HEVa8ze). Our team doesn't have any say over VCSO, so please don't make tickets about it.

### How can I join shifts on console?

In order to join our shifts while on console you must be friends with the server owner. While in most cases if you notify us about this issue before a shift we can add you. We have the right to deny your request, as it's not an ideal way to hand out access.

### How can I join the State Police?

VCF doesn't operate FSP. But we do allow Troopers who are official members of the FSP faction to join the State Police team if certain requirements are met. You can learn more [here](https://discord.gg/neqctBhjb9)

### How can I appeal a ban in VCF?

In order to appeal a ban for our community you must submit an appeal using Dyno. In your ban message Dyno should provide you a way to appeal. If one isn't there, it most likely means your ability to appeal has been denied.
