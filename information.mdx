  <Accordion title="How long do shifts usually last?" icon="hourglass-half">
    Most of our shifts usually run for **1 hour and 30 minutes**. However, there are some cases in which they may be shorter or longer depending on the circumstances.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What timezone are shifts primarily hosted in?" icon="clock">
    Most of our shifts will be hosted in the **EST timezone**, but we plan on expanding this in the future to accommodate more players.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I become a Corrections Officer (CO)?" icon="user-shield">
    To become a CO and play on their team, you must complete an application and be accepted. You can see when applications open in our [announcements channel](https://discord.com/channels/1345804368263385170/1345816347657113702).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I join CERT/RIOT?" icon="shield-halved">
    To join one of these specialized divisions, you must first be a Corrections Officer. Applications for these positions will be announced on the Department of Corrections (DoC) Discord server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I appeal my ban in the main Valley Prison game?" icon="gavel">
    Unfortunately, we don't have any power to unban you from Valley Prison. You must submit an appeal directly to their team by joining their [official appeal server](https://discord.gg/dpPzyrb9Rq).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I become a moderator for VCF?" icon="user-gear">
    To become a moderator for our community, you will need to submit an application and pass an interview. You can learn more about the requirements and process [on our moderation division page](/about-us/moderation-division).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I join the Sheriff's Office (VCSO)?" icon="star">
    We don't operate the Sheriff's team in our community. You can join the Sheriff's Office by joining the official [VCSO Discord](https://discord.gg/Z72HEVa8ze). Please do not make tickets about VCSO in our server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I join the State Police (FSP)?" icon="car-building">
    VCF doesn't operate FSP, but we allow official members of the FSP faction to join the State Police team if certain requirements are met. You can learn more in the [FSP Discord](https://discord.gg/neqctBhjb9).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I join shifts on console (Xbox/PlayStation)?" icon="gamepad">
    To join our shifts on a console, you must be friends with the server owner on Roblox. While we try to accommodate this if you notify us before a shift, we reserve the right to deny the request as it is not an ideal method for access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I appeal a ban from VCF?" icon="user-slash">
    To appeal a ban from our community (not the main game), you must submit an appeal using the link provided by the Dyno bot in your ban message. If a link is not there, it most likely means your ability to appeal has been denied.
