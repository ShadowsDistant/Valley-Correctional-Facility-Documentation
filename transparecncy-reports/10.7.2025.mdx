# Overview

In this report, we will explain recent events and internal issues that transpired within our team. Along with addressing the change in administration, it is important to consider what this means for the community. The actions of both myself and our team where not acceptable, and I know we could have done better.

Over the next few days myself and Shock will be reviewing policies, bans, applications, tickets, suggestions and more. We will also be implementing changes, that we hope will prevent situations like this from occuring again.

## Faction Report

Late last month, we became aware of a faction report made by former members of our team. After obtaining this information, our internal teams worked behind the scenes, ensuring everything was prepared for an audit, along with gaining a better understand of the contents within the report.

During this time, Gambling was sent a message that contained a statement from a user claiming to be close to the Prison Administration team and expressing a complaint. While our team has no problem with users reporting issues to auditors, this was being sent a 3rd party. After the message was forwarded to the Specialized Investigations Division (SID). The team was able to identify the user within an hour as a member of our Prison Administration team. The member was confronted and asked to participate in a "sting" operation to gain more insight into the report.

Days later, when the faction report was finally issued, certain statements within the report were similar to the statement made by a member of the Prison Administration team. This led to internal discussions about the possible removal of the member. The member was asked to screen-share their DM's with the 3rd party, which led to them being exposed as a "double agent".

I have personally spoken to the member, and they have explained their reasoning for helping the 3rd party in their report. And I respect their decision to do so. But I don't agree with the way they decided to help. This incident also led to the leaking of DM's in which another team member's chats were exposed to the staff team, leading to an unsavory outcome for them.

I wasn't concerned with their statement, as their statement was a reflection of their experience, which I can confirm was true. While I might not agree with their method in voicing their concerns, I respect their decision to make their statement known.

## Addressing The Concerns

In the faction report, they listed specific concerns they had. Here are the concerns they brought to us and our comments on them all. I will only be going over concerns directly related to VCF, and not a specific person.

### Jesus Christ Event

I will fully admit that I was a participant in this event, which I now realize was not appropriate for our community or in general. While the event wasn't mocking the religion, the fact that Jesus was being played by a user was not okay. To address this, we will be banning religious roleplay from all of our shifts to ensure events and conduct like this do not happen again. And I would like to apologize for my involvement.

### Wrongful Removals

When Decrypt got removed, almost all high command in DoC either resigned or were terminated. Terminations were handed out for some of the following reasons:

- Privatizing of previously public documents
- Failing to cooperate with the new administration

Documents that were used daily in the DoC were suddenly privated, along with the high command failing to respond to DM's from the new administration. This ultimately led to their terminations. While we understand the documents were their own, we expect high command to be professional enough not to pull stunts like this. In the future, all terminations of high command members from DoC will be required to be reviewed by SID to ensure strict standards.

### Chaotic Shifts

The evidence presented to us to back this claim up showed a clip of a shift that seemed to take place right around the time that the DoC high command were resigning or being terminated. We were unable to have civilized shifts due to the lack of leadership at DoC, and we should have canceled any shifts until replacements were found.

### Lack of Effort

The report shows a chart that is meant to show how many whitelist applications each staff member did. Although I won't attach the image, I will say that it displayed both me and gambling has done 0. I can confirm that I didn't process any whitelist applications, as I specifically asked to be removed from the whitelist staff. I also had just started school and had a lot on my plate. I will say I was actively handling tickets and trying my best to attend as many shifts as I could. What I will say is, we will be looking into setting a quota for moderators of our community to ensure everyone is putting in some effort to make the community better.

## Prevention

To prevent a situation like this from happening again, we plan on making the following changes.

- Ensuring terminations for high-ranking DoC officials are formally reviewed by SID
- Establishing an internal suggestions system for team members to freely express their views
- Formation of an advisory council to give expert-level suggestions and feedback on proposed changes
- Formal review of all previous bans to ensure they meet our requirements
- Formal review of our moderation handbook to ensure quality and accuracy
- Updated permissions to users with the Valley Prison Staff role
- "Anytime Applications" for the our moderator application for Valley Prison moderators
- Open communication channels between the Prison Administration team and Faction Auditors
- Weekly meetings with the Prison Administration team
- Bi-weekly meetings with the entire VCF staff team
- Transparency reports for internal issues or conflicts, so the community stays aware
- Ensuring that Prison Administration members maintain professionalism within official channels
- Reviewing the possibility of assigning a quota to moderators
- Implementing a zero tolerance policy on religious roleplay

With these changes, we hope to improve our internal structure and work environment. Along with improved transparency with the community.

## Our Team

Due to the recent events, Valley Prison's management team has selected me to be the new owner of VCF. I personally agree with their decision and plan on making some changes to ensure that this cycle of new ownership comes to a close. VCF is meant to be a fun community, even for the staff who work here. And lately that has been far from the case.

We will be strengthening our connection with Valley Prison by allowing their staff team to moderate our server, along with giving Valley Prison moderators access to apply for our moderation team at any time, regardless of whether applications are open or not.

After some internal discussion, we will be forming a new advisory council that will be made up of experts in various fields such as community management, administration, and internal affairs. That way, we can ensure that the steps we take in the future are the best ones we can make. The advisors will also be sharing feedback they get from the community, so we can make the best choice for the community as well.

## Delays

During this time, we've had to delay and, in some cases, suspend operations in certain areas. Including the review of moderator applications, shift planning, HSU leadership hiring, tickets, and more. We hope to resume all of these within the coming days as we ensure that our team is fully staffed. And we apologize for the inconvenience this has caused our community.

Due to these delays, our team wasn't able to respond to ticket suggestions for bringing back a gang system and an expanded prison program. We hope to get these sorted within the next few days!

## What's Next

As previously stated, I will be the new owner of VCF. I will also be promoting Shock to Deputy Warden. And we will be searching for a new Assistant Warden.

While this incident is not what any of us wanted to have happen, it's a learning experience for all of us and a deep reflection on what can go wrong if management for VCF doesn't communicate and work as a unified team. With the changes we plan on making, we hope to see the community grow and thrive.

Our team will be working around the clock over the next few days to ensure everything is ready for our next shift.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to DM me personally.
