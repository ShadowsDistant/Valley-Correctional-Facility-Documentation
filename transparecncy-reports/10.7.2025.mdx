# Overview

In this report, we will explain recent events and internal issues that transpired within our team. Along with addressing the change in administration.

## Faction Report

Late last month, we became aware of a faction report made by both Decrypt and Oddrobbers. After obtaining this information, our team worked behind the scenes, ensuring everything was prepared for an audit, along with gaining intelligence about the report.

During this time, Gambling was sent a message that contained a statement from a user claiming to be close to the Prison Administration team and expressing a complaint. While our team has no problem with users reporting issues to auditors, this was being sent to Decrypt. After the message was forwarded to SID, the team was able to identify the user within an hour as a member of our Prison Administration team. The member was confronted and asked to participate in a "sting" operation.

Days later, when the faction report was finally issued, certain statements within the report were similar to the statement made by a member of the Prison Administration team. This led to internal discussions about the possible removal of the member. The member was asked to screen-share their DM's with Decrypt, which led to them being exposed as a "double agent".

I have personally spoken to the member, and they have explained their reasoning for helping Decrypt in their report. And I respect their decision to do so. But I don't agree with the way they decided to help. This incident also led to the leaking of DM's in which another team member's chats were exposed to the staff team, leading to an unsavory outcome for them.

I prefer that I not take issue with the leaking, as their statement was a reflection of their experience, which I can confirm was true. While I might not agree with their method in voicing their concerns, I respect their decision to make their statement known.

## Our Team

Due to the recent events, Valley Prison's management team has selected me to be the new owner of VCF. I personally agree with their decision and plan on making some changes to ensure that this cycle of new ownership comes to a close. VCF is meant to be a fun community, even for the staff who work here. And lately that has been far from the case.

After some internal discussion, we will be forming a new advisory council that will be made up of experts in various fields such as community management, administration, and internal affairs. That way, we can ensure that the steps we take in the future are the best ones we can make. The advisors will also be sharing feedback they get from the community, so we can make the best choice for the community as well.

## Delays

During this time, we've had to delay and in some cases suspend operations in certain areas. Including the review of moderator applications, shift planning, HSU leadership hiring, tickets, and more. We hope to resume all of these within the coming days as we ensure that our team is fully staffed. And we apologize for the inconvenience this has caused our community.

## What's Next

As previously stated, I will be the new owner of VCF. I will also be promoting Shock to Deputy Warden. And we will be searching for a new Assistant Warden.

While this incident is not what any of us wanted to have happen, it's a learning experience for all of us and a deep reflection on what can go wrong if management for VCF doesn't communicate and work as a unified team. With the changes we plan on making, we hope to see the community grow and thrive.

Our team will be working around the clock during the next few days to ensure that everything is ready for our next shift!
