## Roleplay Types

To ensure that our community is safe and fun for everyone, we recommend that players do the following types of roleplay. Also listed are the dos and don'ts. For every kind of scene. This is **NOT** a full list, and goes over some of the most popular scenes; it also doesn't include a full list of don'ts.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Medical Scene">
    Roleplay having a headache, or other appropriate medical emergency. You are not allowed to roleplay drug usage, mental health issues, or any medical roleplay deemed inappropriate by our team.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hostage Situations">
    Roleplay taking another player hostage using some sort of weapon or force. What we don't allow is: taking more than one person hostage at a time, failing to engage in negotiations, and making unrealistic demands.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Disobeying Orders">
    Not following orders given to you by a member of the Department of Corrections. But continuously disobeying orders or having disregard for your safety is not allowed.
