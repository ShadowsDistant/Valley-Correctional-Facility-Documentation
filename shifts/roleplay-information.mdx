## Forbidden Roleplay Mechanics

Players are not allowed to engage in or use the following roleplay tactics at any time.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Baiting" icon="fish">
    Intentionally provoking staff members (like Corrections Officers) with low-effort, unrealistic actions to get an out-of-character reaction, annoy them, or waste their time. Your in-character actions should have an in-character purpose.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intrusion / Interfering" icon="person-to-door">
    Forcing your way into a roleplay scene that you are not a part of. If a scene is taking place in a private area or between specific individuals, you must have a valid in-character reason to join. Respect the stories other players are trying to build.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Powergaming" icon="bolt">
    Forcing actions upon another player without giving them a chance to react, or creating a character that is unrealistically powerful or "invincible." You only control your own character's actions and attempts, not the outcome for another player.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Metagaming" icon="brain-circuit">
    Using knowledge that you, the player, have out-of-character (OOC) to give your in-character (IC) person an unfair advantage. You must separate what YOU know from what your CHARACTER knows through in-game roleplay.
