## Overview

Our community operates shifts that all the community to join a private server operated by our staff. Within a shift things are very different from playing on a normal server. In our shifts, we enforce roleplay unlike public servers. We also restrict the usage of teams, meaning the only the inmate team is public and avaliable to all members.
