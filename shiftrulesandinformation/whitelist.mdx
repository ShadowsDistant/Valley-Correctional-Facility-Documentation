## Overview

A whitelist is required to attend a shift. If you don't have the "whitelist" role in our Discord, then you won't be able to attend our shifts. Whitelisting helps us ensure that attendee's are fimilar with our rules and regulations, and that they are aware of what's expected of them.

## Becoming Whitelisted

To apply for a whitelist, look in our Discord for the channel where you can apply. You will be prompted to apply using the Discord bot Appy. After completeing and answer the questions within the application, it will be sent to our review team. After they review it you will get a notification saying you've either been approved or denied. Denied applicants must wait 72 hours before they can apply again. Approve applicants will recieve the whitelist role in our Discord, and will gain immediate access to the shift channel.

### Step-By-Step

1. Head to the "shift-whitelist" channel in our Discord
2. Click and start the application using Appy
3. Complete the application
4. Wait for your results

Our team is small, so your results may take up to 72 hours to be posted. Please be patient, and refrain from asking our team to review your application.

## Revoked Whitelist

If a member of the community who is whitelist shows that they cannot follow our rules and regulators or Valley Prison's rules our staff team reserves the right to remove you from our whitelist.
